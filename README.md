# GoogleHome-Azan-Player

This application automatically fetches prayer times from AlAdhan and plays the Azan on a Google Home device. It:
1) Letâ€™s you set your city, country, and calculation method.
2) Fetches fresh prayer times daily.
3) Schedules the Azan 1 minute ahead of each prayer time and runs indefinitely.
4) Raises the device volume for the Azan, then restores it.

## Setup

To kill the process:
